My name is Sarah Cousins Hoopes. I have the following qualities:

- There is nothing I do better than talk about nothing all day
- Problem solver commonly found repurposing items for creative use in unintended ways

What else do you need?

### My history

In short, I was born, grew up the old fashioned way and got hooked on computers at age 9 or 10 (I know, so late!) when I somehow missed that I was usually the only female in the room. Back off buddy, I have problems to solve. Got a few degrees and started getting paid to do this stuff full time. That sequence of events may be a little off.
